Tariff language regarding critical peak hours: 

```
The Company expects to implement Critical Peak pricing for no more than 56 hours per year, for evaluation of
the tariff based on several factors including but not limited to economics, system demand or capacity deficiency.

Customers will be notified up to 24 hours before, but no less than 6 hours before critical hours are expected to
occur. Notification will be made by one or more of the following methods: automated telephone message, text
message, e-mail, or presentment on an in-premise display unit furnished by the Company. Receipt of such
notice is the responsibility of the participating customer.

## D1.11 Standard Time-of-Use Residential Electric Service Rate

### Special Note

Per the MPSC order in rate case U-20836, DTE has until May 31, 2023 to start offering the D1.11 plan to customers. 

Additionally, there is probably going to be a campaign to get residential customers who are on the D1 plan to switch to D1.11. From the sound of it, DTE will probably start promoting the new D1.11 plan on bills / bill inserts / etc, and may even set a deadline after which they will automatically move customers from D1 to D1.11 unless the customer opts out.
